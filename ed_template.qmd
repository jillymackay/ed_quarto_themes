## Why use Quarto?

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. 


To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

# You can have sections like this

## And important things: {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

And citations are managed via pandoc per [the @quartoguide23].

It's also good to reference [@knuth84] for no particular reason. 

:::


:::{.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "A lovely chart"

plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$mpg)

```

:::

::::

## And other stuff

```{r}
#| echo: true 

# like code obviously

3 * 3

```
